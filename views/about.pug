            | I have been teaching PM at General Assembly close to 4 years. Here I get to learn from students about the trials and tribulations they have in their roles at PMs, teach how PM should be done by the book, and lastly integrate lessons I’ve learned from my clients. Additionally, I write a lot (over 100 posts) on Medium about Product Management and Strategy.
